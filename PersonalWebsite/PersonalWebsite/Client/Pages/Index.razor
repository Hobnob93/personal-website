                I am currently a software developer at File Dynamics Ltd, in Bristol, which is a position I have been in for about a year. The work is focused
                on building web and WPF applications, centred around the legal sector. I also have a Masters degree in Games Development, awarded at
                University of Central Lancashire in 2017. I hope to one day get my doctorate, because who doesn't want to be a doctor of computers?

                The purpose of this website is to give insight into myself, my interests, and some projects I have worked on. I also used remaking my
                site as an excuse to learn Blazor with .NET 5. Feel free to have a nosey around! If you have any questions, or suggestions on how to 
                improve the site, please don't hesitate to contact me.

                I have also added a section to my website recently, which aims to show educational visualisations to common algorithms. I hope you find it 
                as entertaining to use as I did making it! :)
