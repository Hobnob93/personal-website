                I was born in South Africa, and grew up there until I was 7. At schoold, we had a computer room, but there was no internet. The apps were severely 
                limited, as was our allotted time. An event occured at the school where a bus arrived with modern computers on board. Only select students were 
                chosen. Luckily for me, I was one of them! It was the first time on the internet, browsing websites (no Reddit back then), but I was amazed!

                After moving to Bristol, UK, my parents got a home computer. Hearing the dial-up tone was my favourite part of the weekend, and I found the old 
                disk defragmentation animations mesmorising. Sadly I wasn't allowed to use it much, but a few years later, my parents got a replacement computer. 
                Luckily for me, I got the old PC! I spent every hour of every day that I could on it. Learning about how it worked, various applications, and 
                messing around on spreadsheets, of all things.

                Eventually, I discovered my love for programming. I dived into an application called GameMaker, and eventually learned to use their GML language 
                to make my own cool things. I took every ICT subject for GCSE and A Levels that I could, and was fortunate enough to learn some Visual Basic along 
                the way.

                Not once did I think "programming" was a job you could have - until I started applying to University. That's when I discovered Computer Science. 
                As I had used GameMaker, I felt gravitated towards a Games Development course at UCLan, and ended up with a Masters somehow. Although I chose to 
                not go into games development as a career, I still make games in my own time. I continue to keep up to date in that field, while enjoying web development.
